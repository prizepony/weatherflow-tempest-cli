# weatherflow-tempest-cli

## Setup

The project is built using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once open, run the tasks `meson-init`.

### MacOS

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is used for managing packages on my build system. Follow instructions at their website for installing Homebrew.

After Homebrew is installed, run the following in a terminal:

```
brew install meson boost
```
